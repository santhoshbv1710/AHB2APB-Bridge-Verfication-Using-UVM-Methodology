# AHB2APB-Bridge-Verfication-Using-UVM-Methodology


Verified the AHB to APB Bridge IP Core, an AHB slave enabling communication between high-speed AHB and low-performance APB buses. Architected a UVM-based verification environment, defined the verification plan, and validated the RTL using diverse test scenarios, including single and burst read/write operations. Ensured protocol compliance through rigorous testing methodologies. Achieved functional and code coverage closure for verification sign-off, optimizing the testbench for efficiency and reusability.
